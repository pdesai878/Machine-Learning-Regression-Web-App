# ðŸ“ˆ Machine Learning Regression Web-App

Successfully built and tested a very powerful ml regression web app using developers( beta ) version of Streamlit and python. This app basically compares results of different regression models with their metrics score and effectively visualizes diagnostic plots. This app can be very useful for machine learning practitioners, you can tune hyperparameters of the model, set the train and the test size with the help of interactive widgets created in this web app.
